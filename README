# SimpleDoubleRatchet

A simple to use, transport agnostic implementation of [The Double Ratchet Algorithm](https://whispersystems.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/) created by Open Whisper Systems.

## Demo

	- Alice is the initial sender, Bob is the initial receiver.
	- Alice starts the handshake which gets sent over the already connected transport layer.
	- Bob must wait for a message from Alice before sending his first message.
